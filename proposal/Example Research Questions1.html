<li><span style="font-size: 19px;"><em>Bad: </em>What is the average monthly rainfall in Nova Scotia?</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 19px;">This question can be easily answered by taking simple summary statistics of the raw data of monthly rainfall. The question is not deep enough to show your mastery of the course content.</span></li>

<li><span style="font-size: 19px;"><em>Better</em>: What is the relationship between monthly rainfall and tourism dollars spent?</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 19px;">Questions that ask about relationships between variables give you the space to choose between competing models and use the other techniques we have learned in the course such as residual analysis and model selection.<br></span><span style="font-size: 19px;"></span></li>

<li><span style="font-size: 19px;"><em>Bad</em>: What is the linear relationship between NHL team standings and game attendance?</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 19px;">Your research question shouldn't assume a particular relationship between variables. In addition, the reason why you're interested in this particular relationship is not clear.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 19px;"><em>Better</em>: How can NHL teams improve attendance?</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 19px;">The research question is guided by a clear, practical goal. It is phrased in such a way that you can try and find multiple predictor variables that are relevant to the goal, and the model you use will be motivated by the data instead of being assumed in the research question.<br></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">You can be as creative as you want in making your research question, but keep in mind...</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 19px;">You need to be able to find data to answer your research question</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 19px;">You need to show a mastery of the course content&nbsp;<em>or</em> other statistical methods at a similar level that we haven't covered explicitly in class</span><span style="font-size: 19px;"></span></li>
